  <pre><code>vmtkmarchingcubes --help
Creating vmtkMarchingCubes instance.
Automatic piping vmtkmarchingcubes

vmtkmarchingcubes : generate an isosurface of given level from a 3D image
Input arguments:
	-id Id(int,1); default=0: script id
	-handle Self (self,1): handle to self
	-disabled Disabled (bool,1); default=0: disable execution and piping
	-i Image (vtkImageData,1): the input image
	-ifile ImageInputFileName(str,1): filename for the default Image Reader
	-array ArrayName (str,1): name of the array to work with
	-l Level(float,1); default=0.0: graylevel to generate the isosurface at
	-connectivity Connectivity (bool,1); default=0: only output the largest connected region of the isosurface
	-ofile SurfaceOutputFileName (str,1): filename for the default Surface writer
Output arguments:
	-id Id (int,1); default= 0: script id
	-handle Self (self,1): handle to self
	-o Surface (vtkPolyData,1): the output surface</code></pre>

<div class="snippet-explanation" style="width: 100%; padding-left:0px;">

<p>Writing classes implementing <code>algorithms</code> and writing actual tools 
to be used for everyday work are two distinct tasks. </br>Very often a well-designed 
object-oriented library ends up to be used in ever-growing collections of shell, 
Python or Tcl scripts or small C programs, each with its own argument parsing and 
I/O sections. Very often high-level code is duplicated to provide slightly different 
<code>functionality</code>. On the other side, writing a GUI is a time-consuming task, and adding 
new functionality requires time, which might deter experimentation. <code>PypeS</code> goes in the 
direction of providing a flexible <code>framework</code> for <code>high-level</code> code, both from the user’s 
and from the developer’s points of view. The user wants to get things done minimizing 
the work required and the amount of intermediate data generated. The coder wants to limit 
the amount of code, she/he has to cut and paste (and maintain), and to quickly add new 
functionality and make it interact with what she/he’s ever written before.
