TOFIX

Developers in countries all over the world are using Scala for a large variety of applications across a broad range of industries. Popular ways to connect with the Scala community are via mailing lists or IRC channels, listed below.

Though there are plenty of opportunities to connect face-to-face with others in the community-- for example, via local [Scala Meetups](http://scala.meetup.com/), or local [Scala user groups](http://www.scala-tribes.org).


## Mailing Lists

The main forum for questions and discussions about the vascular modeling toolkit is hosted on google groups:
