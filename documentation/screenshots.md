## Segmentation of arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis from MRA

Segmentation of the vasculature of the arm in a patient with an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. MRA images were acquired by Dr. Nils Planken, AZM Maastricht, The Netherlands.

Level sets segmentation of the cephalic (left) and a collateral vein (right). Segmentation is carried out separately. Each image shows the initialization on the left and the result of level set segmentation. Initialization is performed by interactively picking two points (red spheres), and the [itkCollidingFrontsImageFilter](http://public.kitware.com/Insight/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1CollidingFrontsImageFilter.html) selects the vascular segment comprised between the points, without seeping into lateral branches.

Identification of the bifurcation plane relative to the aneurysm neck. Normals along centerlines are generated using a parallel transport method starting from the orientation of the bifurcation plane.

## Mapping and patching the vessel surface

Based on centerlines and splitting, the surface on the left, color-coded by wall shear stress (obtained from a CFD simulation), is mapped through the generation of longitudinal harmonic maps (center) (which are then properly stretched to reflect centerline abscissas) and circumferential parallel transport normals angular metrics. Once mapped onto a rectangular 2D parametric space, each branch can be patched (right). This technique allows to compare surface-based quantities across populations.

Once mapped, the bifurcation can be flattened onto a single stripe and stored as an image. Each portion of the stripe (left) refers to a different branch (from lower to upper, common, internal and external carotid artery). The flattened longitudinal harmonic map is shown in the center, while the patched wall shear stress distribution is shown on the right. The tabular nature of the data allows easy statistical analysis on the surface data.
