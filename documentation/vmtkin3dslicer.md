## The Vascular Modeling Toolkit in 3D Slicer 4

The <a href="http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Slicer4:VMTK" target="_blank">SlicerVmtk4</a> extension will be available for 3D Slicer4 soon. Main difference to the Slicer3 version is that now all VMTK modules come as one extension bundle. This should enhance the installation experience for users.
Also, the general focus was on enhancing the usability of the modules by providing parameter-free simple modes in addition to full-blown advanced modes.
