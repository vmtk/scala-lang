Thanks to the work of Sara Zanchi and Valentina Rossi, who just joined us at Orobix for their internship and helped us porting the tutorials, the transition to the Github-hosted website has been completed. Take a look at the [website repository](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk.github.com) to see how it's done. Thanks to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), we could reproduce the same urls.

By the way, last night I also switched off the Sourceforge svn and git repositories. From now on, [https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk) takes over.
