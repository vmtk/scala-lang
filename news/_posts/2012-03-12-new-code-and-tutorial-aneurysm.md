A new directory has been added to vmtk, called vmtkApps. It will contain application-specific code built on top of vmtk.

As a first entry, Marina Piccinelli (Emory Univ) has contributed an implementation of Matthew Ford's algorithm for digital removal of cerebral aneurysms (Ford et al, BJR 2009). Check it out with the [tutorial](/Tutorials/ParentVesselReconstruction/). The code is at the [vmtk repository](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk).
