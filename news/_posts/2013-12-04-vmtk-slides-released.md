title: "Released vmtk workshop/courses slides."
---

We are releasing presentations material from conferences, workshops or courses, for free.

Currently available presentations are in html format and are listed in the [presentation page]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/presentations.html) under the [documentation section.]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation).

We released slides from the vmtk workshop at the VPH study group in Barcelona 2012, from the vmtk course at Cilea (Milan) 2011 and from the vmtk workshop at the 2008 ASME summer bioengineering conference.

Take at look at the date of the presentation since vmtk might be evolved in a few aspects.
