In practice, the output of a level set segmentation is an image. The advantage of using a deformable model (either explicit or level sets) is that the location of the surface will not depend on the level you choose, but instead it will locally conform to the peaks of the gradient modulus of the image levels. In other words, the final surface will be located on the regions corresponding to the steepest change of image intensity across the vessel wall, which is a robust and objective criterion.","targetRectangle":{"y":199.7445616722107,"x":15.7915415763855,"width":837.6181764602666,"height":442.640625}},{"text":"image11.png","targetRectangle":{"y":99.75590515136719,"x":851.33984375,"width":810.8309326171875,"height":284.330078125}},{"text":"3rd VPH study group on VPH Toolkit â€“ May 7th 11th, 2012","targetRectangle":{"y":17,"x":428.0463290857733,"width":848.9257830998395,"height":36.00000018771971}},{"text":"http://www.vmtk.org/","targetRectangle":{"y":52.32661581039429,"x":4.036533921957016,"width":246.748046875,"height":27}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":true,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":840,"pointY":525},"width":1680,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1050,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":0,"layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":840,"pointY":525},"width":1680,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.000360081385372553,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":15,"height":1050,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":840,"pointY":525},"width":1680,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1050,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"6A28C09E4CA024778C1ACB78209E81F9"},{"animations":[{"from":{"scalar":false},"property":"hidden","beginTime":0,"to":{"scalar":true},"fillMode":"both","duration":0.01}],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":840,"pointY":525},"width":1680,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1050,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"B9D8974FDBAC405BDCBB4FE678715C66"}]}]}}]} } )
